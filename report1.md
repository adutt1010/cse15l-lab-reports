Lab report 1:

The first time the cd comman was run, it set the directory as home, which is shown when I used the command pwd.  
The second time I ran the cd command with an argument of the messages directory, it set the directory to home/lecture1/messages.  
The third time I ran the cd command with an argument of the fr.txt file located in the messages directory, it gave us an error, as a file cannot be a directory. The directory did not change after running the comman the third time, because previous argument was a filename, and as a result the directory is still home/lecture1/messages.
